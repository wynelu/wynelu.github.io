OmniFocus是我非常喜欢的GTD应用，尤其是Mac版和iPhone版配合起来使用非常方便有效。支持语义化输入是OmniFocus非常棒的功能，当然现在很多的GTD、日程相关的应用都在支持语义化了。

+ now = the time and day you typed this in
+ tom = tomorrow
+ tod = today
+ yes = yesterday
+ 7d = 7 days from today
+ 3w = 3 weeks from today
+ 5m = 5 months from today
+ 4pm = today at 4pm
+ next saturday = Saturday the following week
+ 5m7d = 5 months and 7 days from today
+ 7/12 = July 12
+ tom @ 4pm = tomorrow at 4pm = tomorrow at 4pm
+ 4/31 = 5/1 = OmniFocus automatically corrects non-existent dates
