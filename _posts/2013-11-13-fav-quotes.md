Gage: Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention? 

Mark Zuckerberg: [stares out the window] No. 

Gage: Do you think I deserve it? 

Mark Zuckerberg: [looks at Gage] What? 

Gage: Do you think I deserve your full attention? 

Mark Zuckerberg: I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition, and I don't want to perjure myself, so I have a legal obligation to say no. 

Gage: Okay - no. You don't think I deserve your attention. 

Mark Zuckerberg: I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall, they have the right to give it a try - but there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie. You have part of my attention - you have the minimum amount. The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. 

[pauses] 

Mark Zuckerberg: Did I adequately answer your condescending question?
