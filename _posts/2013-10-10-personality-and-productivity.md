title: "个性和效率（personality和productivity）"
description: "个性、性格的不同导致不同人在效率方面有明显的区别。"

过滤Feedly订阅发现一篇好文章，谈个性导致效率的问题，读过一遍之后结合自己想想，确实是有道理的。

The Happiness Project的作者 Gretchen Rubin介绍了她正在研究的[四种性格模型](http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2013/03/do-you-agree-about-these-motivations-of-the-upholder-questioner-rebel-and-obliger/)：

> 
* **Upholders** respond to both inner and outer rules; 

>
* **Questioners** question all rules, but can follow rules they endorse (effectively making all rules into inner rules); 

>
* **Rebels** resist all rules; 

>
* **Obligers** respond to outer rules but not to inner rules.

对照[这篇文章](http://www.documentsnap.com/which-personality-type-are-you/)来看：

>
+ For Upholders, it’s all about having a plan and a to-do list. Make sure the next action in your project is defined.

>
+ For Questioners, it is all about the outcome. Focus on not just what needs to be done, but why you need to do it.

>
+ For Obligers, it is helpful to have other people involved or at least aware of your project. Share your successes and challenges, and make sure you have someone that is holding you accountable. Things like the Paperless Action Plan can be helpful too.

>
+ For Rebels, you’re not going to listen to me anyways so, uh, don’t go paperless! Kidding – I would think it would be helpful to always have your end goal in mind. What are you working towards, and is your next action going to take you there?
